# Paseo Cafe

Browse the [paseo.cafe](https://paseo.cafe) plugin catalog from inside Paseo, and install
plugins without leaving the app.

The plugin adds a **Paseo Cafe** sidebar surface listing every plugin in the catalog with its
description, categories, platforms, Paseo version requirement, caveats, health checks, and
screenshots. Searching and filtering happen on the client; installing runs `paseo plugin add`
on the daemon host behind a confirmation step. A **Paseo plugin** composer attachment source
lets you attach a plugin's full listing to a prompt when you want an agent to review it before
you trust it.

## Install

```bash
paseo plugin add paseo-cafe/paseo-cafe:plugin
```

Requires a Paseo 0.8 release; the manifest declares `requirements.paseo` as `^0.8.0`.

By default the catalog is read from `https://paseo.cafe/api/plugins`. Point **Settings →
Plugins → Paseo Cafe** at another deployment (a local `bun run dev`, a staging build, or a
self-hosted fork) that serves the same shape. `PASEO_CAFE_DIRECTORY_URL` on the daemon is a
lower-priority fallback for hosts that cannot persist plugin settings.

A custom catalog must use HTTPS, or HTTP on loopback (`localhost`, `*.localhost`,
`127.0.0.0/8`, `[::1]`). The catalog picks which repositories the install button hands to the
`paseo` CLI, so anyone able to rewrite a plaintext response chooses what gets installed on the
daemon host.

Install reporting is off by default. **Settings → Plugins → Paseo Cafe → Share approximate
install counts** opts this daemon into reporting genuinely new, successful installs started from
the default catalog. Updates, already-installed no-ops, failed installs, custom catalogs, and
catalog entries the daemon cannot verify are not reported. A later reinstall after removal is a
new install event and may be counted again.

Each report contains exactly the public catalog plugin ID and a fresh operation nonce used only
to deduplicate that install's bounded retries. It contains no machine or installation identifier,
plugin inventory, or arbitrary metadata. Cloudflare necessarily processes the request IP.
Published counts are therefore approximate reported installs, not unique users or machines.
Revoking consent cancels pending in-memory reports; there is no persistent retry queue.

Reports go to `https://api.paseo.cafe/v1/install`. A trusted daemon environment may set
`PASEO_CAFE_SERVICE_URL` to another HTTPS service origin, or to an HTTP loopback origin for local
smoke testing. The plugin app cannot choose this destination.

## Limitations

- Plugins listed here are community-submitted and are not vetted by paseo.cafe. They are
  trusted, unsandboxed code on your daemon host: read the source before installing.
- Installing shells out to the `paseo` CLI, so that binary must be on the daemon's `PATH`.
- The composer attachment source always searches the default catalog. Paseo calls an
  attachment search with the query alone, and a plugin's server handler cannot read its own
  settings, so a custom Catalog URL applies to the sidebar surface only.
- Catalog responses are cached on the daemon for five minutes. **Refresh** bypasses that cache.
